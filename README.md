### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Turner.

I am a Computer Science and business student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have advanced skills in Backend development and am also proficient in Frontend development. I enjoy Dev-ops and connecting different systems together (Fullstack projects are my jam ðŸŽ¸)

Some projects:
- [Droplet Server](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Droplet-Server), a highly scalable and advanced Spring boot server that interacts with a PSQL database - used for _Droplet_
- [Droplet IOS](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Droplet-IOS), a lightweight but shiny SwiftUI IOS app that is in active development alongside the Server ^ - used for _Droplet_
- [Project Cluster-Prism](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Project-Cluster-Prism), a Fullstack project using the MERN(Mongo, Express, React, Node) tech stack.



- ðŸŒ± I am looking to grow my experience and knowledege in Network/Systems programming, AI (Best ways to use it!) - Anything else! I need suggestions...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a small indie game project. I joined [Beckman](https://github.com/Beckman123) and helped work on [Dashmaster](https://github.com/Beckman123/Dash-Master), a Java based movement and evasion game.
