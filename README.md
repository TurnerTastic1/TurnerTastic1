### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Turner.

I am a Computer Science and business student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am skilled in full-stack engineering, software design and testing, deployment automation, Kubernetes and other cloud solutions. I have a deep passion for writing impactful code and leveraging technology to solve complex problems.

In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about the startup ecosystem and the SaaS industry. I have actively participated in multiple startups as part of both engineering and product teams. I am always eager to leverage my technical expertise in entrepreneurial ventures.

Some projects:
- [Droplet Server](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Droplet-Server), a highly scalable and advanced Spring boot server that interacts with a PSQL database - used for _Droplet_
- [Droplet IOS](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Droplet-IOS), a lightweight but shiny SwiftUI IOS app that is in active development alongside the Server ^ - used for _Droplet_
- [Project Cluster-Prism](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1/Project-Cluster-Prism), a Fullstack project using the MERN(Mongo, Express, React, Node) tech stack.



- ðŸŒ± I am looking to grow my experience and knowledege in Network/Systems programming, AI (Best ways to use it!) - Anything else! I need suggestions...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a small indie game project. I joined [Beckman](https://github.com/Beckman123) and helped work on [Dashmaster](https://github.com/Beckman123/Dash-Master), a fun Java based movement and evasion game. I am learning OpenGL through the University of Colorado and expanding my graphics knowledge.
